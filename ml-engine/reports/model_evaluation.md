## Baseline Model
1. Architecture: 1 Hidden Layer
2. Epochs: 50
3. Test MAE: 2537.93

## Improved Model
Changes Made:
1. Added extra hidden layer
2. Increased neurons
3. Applied feature scaling
4. Trained for 100 epochs

## Improved Model Results
Test MAE: 2531.06

## Performance Comparison
Baseline MAE: 2537.93
Improved MAE: 2531.06

## Observations
1. Training loss decreased steadily.
2. Validation loss remained slightly higher than training loss.
3. No severe overfitting observed.
4. Improvement is small due to limited dataset size (34 rows).

## Conclusion
The improved model performs slightly better compared to baseline.
