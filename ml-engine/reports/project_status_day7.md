# Project Status – Day 7 (Foundation Phase Completion)

## Completed Work

1. Dataset analysis and documentation
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature selection
4. Baseline neural network model
5. Improved neural network model
6. Model evaluation and comparison
7. Model saving using joblib
8. Git workflow with feature branches

## Working Correctly

1. Dataset loads successfully
2. Cleaned dataset is stored
3. Improved model runs without errors
4. Saved models (.joblib) exist
5. TensorFlow environment works

## Known Limitations

1. Dataset size is small
2. Limited feature engineering
3. No advanced hyperparameter tuning
4. No automated pipeline yet

## Next Improvements

1. Add RMSE and R² metrics
3. Add loss curve visualization
4. Implement early stopping
5. Improve feature engineering
6. Expand dataset


# Self Assessment

### Strength
I successfully implemented an end-to-end ML pipeline and maintained proper documentation and Git workflow.

### Area to Improve
I need deeper understanding of advanced hyperparameter tuning and optimization strategies.

### Dependency
I will rely on improved model evaluation techniques and collaboration in the next phase.
